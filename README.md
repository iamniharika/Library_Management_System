# Library Management System

A Python-based Library Management System with a user authentication feature using Tkinter and SQLite. This system allows admins and users to log in, manage books, issue/return books, and manage memberships. It also includes password hashing for secure user authentication.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login with hashed passwords using SQLite database.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Add books, manage users, and manage transactions.
- **User Dashboard**: Issue, return books and pay fines.
- **Password Protection**: Passwords are hashed and stored securely in the database.

## Prerequisites
This project uses Python 3.x and requires the following libraries:
- Tkinter (for the GUI)
- SQLite (for the database)
- hashlib (for password hashing)

These libraries are part of the Python standard library, so you don't need to install them separately.
